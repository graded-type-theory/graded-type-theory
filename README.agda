-- The code does not follow the paper exactly. Notably, the
-- formalisation contains parameters that make it possible to control
-- whether certain features should be included or not (in addition to
-- the possibility to choose what modality to use):

-- * One can have a theory with a single mode, or two modes, and there
--   can be a (dedicated) natrec-star operator, or the alternative
--   usage rule for natrec from Section 7.1.4 can be used.
--
--   Two mutually exclusive types, Dedicated-star and No-dedicated-star,
--   are used to control which usage rules are available for natrec. If
--   Dedicated-star is inhabited, then the rule with the natrec-star
--   operator is used, and if No-dedicated-star is inhabited, then the
--   other rule is used.

Modality-variant  = Graded.Modality.Variant.Modality-variant
Dedicated-star    = Graded.Modality.Dedicated-star.Dedicated-star
No-dedicated-star = Graded.Modality.Dedicated-star.No-dedicated-star

-- * One can choose whether to allow use of the unit type with
--   η-equality. Furthermore one can choose whether to allow binders
--   of the form B_p^q, where p and q are grades and B is "Π", "Σ
--   without η-equality" or "Σ with η-equality":

types = Definition.Typed.Restrictions.Type-restrictions

--   This parameter does not affect the syntax, but if a term has a
--   certain type ("Unit" or "B_p^q C D"), then this type must be
--   allowed:

Unit-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.⊢∷Unit→Unit-allowed
ΠΣ-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.⊢∷ΠΣ→ΠΣ-allowed

-- * One can choose whether to allow the term prodrec_r,p^q:

prodrec = Graded.Usage.Restrictions.Usage-restrictions

--   This only affects the usage relation. If prodrec_r,p^q A t u is
--   well-resourced (under any mode), then the term is allowed:

prodrec-allowed = Graded.Usage.Inversion.inv-usage-prodrec

--   One can use this parameter to rule out erased matches:

no-erased-matches = Graded.Restrictions.no-erased-matches

-- Note that some results have only been proved for certain variants
-- of the theory.

-- There are also other differences between the paper and the
-- formalisation. Quite a few such differences are noted below.

-- Some modules used below are parameterized by a collection of equality
-- relations over terms and types and properties of these relations.
-- This is used by the reducibility logical relation, allowing the
-- fundamental lemma to be proven for any equality relation satisfying
-- these properties, in particular the normal type and term equality
-- and the algorithmic equality relations.

-- 3: Modalities as Ordered Semirings

-- Definition 3.1: Modalities.
--
-- For the variant of the type theory in Sections 3-5 the mode 𝟘ᵐ should
-- be disallowed, i.e. 𝟘ᵐ-allowed should be false, and there should be
-- a dedicated natrec-star operator, i.e. ⊛-available should be
-- inhabited.
--
-- Unlike in the paper equality is not required to be decidable.
-- Instead this property is assumed where it is used.
--
-- This module also defines the concept of a modality with "well
-- behaved zero" which is used in Section 6.

-- 4: Type Theory with Grades

-- The grammar of the language.
--
-- The syntax is not defined in the same way as in the paper:
--
-- * The syntax is well-scoped: the type of terms is indexed by the
--   number of variables in the context.
--
-- * Terms are either variables or applications of "kinds" to terms.
--
-- * The type Kind is indexed by a list of natural numbers. The length
--   of the lists specifiy the arities of constructors (the number of
--   sub-terms) and each element how many extra variables each term
--   argument takes. Where applicable, the "kind" also specifies any
--   constructor arguments that are not terms.
--
-- For instance, instead of three plain constructors for Π, Σ_& and
-- Σ_⊗ there is a kind constructor Binderkind of type
--
--   (b : BinderMode) (p q : M) → Kind (0 ∷ 1 ∷ []).
--
-- The type BinderMode represents "Π, Σ_& or Σ_⊗", and the two
-- arguments of type M are the two quantities of the binders. (The
-- syntax always allows the graded Σ-types from Section 8.) The list
-- 0 ∷ 1 ∷ [] means that the binders take two arguments, one with n
-- variables in the context (for some n), and one with 1 + n variables
-- in the context.
--
-- Pattern synonyms are used so that one can write code which is
-- closer to the notation in the paper.
--
-- The formalization includes a unit type with eta equality which is
-- not covered by the paper except for a discussion in Section 7.3.
-- One can disable the use of the unit type at the type level (see
-- above).

grammar = Definition.Untyped.Term

-- Weakenings.
--
-- Unlike in the paper the type of weakenings is well-scoped: it is
-- indexed by two natural numbers, the sizes of the target and source
-- contexts, respectively.

-- constructor ↑ is called step.

-- single grade.
