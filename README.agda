-- Differences between this version of the code and the code that the
-- paper refers to
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This is not the version of the code that the paper refers to. Some
-- things have been added, but things have also changed.

-- One notable change is related to the natrec-star operators. The
-- paper does not focus on linearity, but some modalities for linear
-- and/or affine types are discussed. It was discovered that using
-- those modalities, and in particular the natrec-star operators of
-- those modalities, one can prove that a certain doubling function,
-- basically λ n. n + n, is linear (or affine). Furthermore one can
-- prove that a certain implementation of addition with a linear type
-- is not well-resourced, even though that would arguably make sense.

-- In order to make the theory more flexible the natrec-star operator
-- in the main usage rule for natrec has been replaced by an "nr
-- function" (natrec usage function). Previously the usage rule had
--
--   (γ ∧ᶜ η) ⊛ᶜ δ +ᶜ p ·ᶜ η ▷ r
--
-- in the conclusion. Now the conclusion instead contains
--
--   nrᶜ p r γ δ η.

usage-relation = Graded.Usage._▸[_]_

-- The nr functions have to satisfy certain properties, and every
-- valid natrec-star operator gives rise to a valid nr function:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Differences between the paper and the code
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The code does not follow the paper exactly. Notably, the
-- formalisation contains parameters that make it possible to control
-- whether certain features should be included or not (in addition to
-- the possibility to choose what modality to use):

-- * One can have a theory with a single mode, or two modes, and there
--   can be a (dedicated) nr function, or the alternative usage rule
--   for natrec from Section 7.1.4 can be used.
--
--   Two mutually exclusive types, Dedicated-nr and No-dedicated-nr,
--   are used to control which usage rules are available for natrec.
--   If Dedicated-nr is inhabited, then the rule with the nr function
--   is used, and if No-dedicated-nr is inhabited, then the other rule
--   is used.

Modality-variant  = Graded.Modality.Variant.Modality-variant
Dedicated-star    = Graded.Modality.Dedicated-nr.Dedicated-nr
No-dedicated-star = Graded.Modality.Dedicated-nr.No-dedicated-nr

-- * One can choose whether to allow use of the unit type with
--   η-equality. Furthermore one can choose whether to allow binders
--   of the form B_p^q, where p and q are grades and B is "Π", "Σ
--   without η-equality" or "Σ with η-equality":

types = Definition.Typed.Restrictions.Type-restrictions

--   This parameter does not affect the syntax, but if a term has a
--   certain type ("Unit" or "B_p^q C D"), then this type must be
--   allowed:

Unit-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.⊢∷Unit→Unit-allowed
ΠΣ-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.⊢∷ΠΣ→ΠΣ-allowed

-- * One can choose whether to allow the term prodrec_r,p^q:

prodrec = Graded.Usage.Restrictions.Usage-restrictions

--   This only affects the usage relation. If prodrec_r,p^q A t u is
--   well-resourced (with respect to any mode), then the term is
--   allowed:

prodrec-allowed = Graded.Usage.Inversion.inv-usage-prodrec

--   One can use this parameter to rule out erased matches:

no-erased-matches = Graded.Restrictions.no-erased-matches

-- Note that some results have only been proved for certain variants
-- of the theory.

-- Some modules are parameterized by a collection of equality
-- relations and properties of those relations. The reducibility
-- logical relation and its fundamental lemmas are defined/proved for
-- any such collection, and can be instantiated for either the normal
-- type and term equality, or algorithmic equality relations.

-- There are also other differences between the paper and the
-- formalisation. Quite a few such differences are noted below.

-- 3: Modalities as Ordered Semirings

-- Definition 3.1: Modalities.
--
-- As discussed above the natrec-star operators from the paper have
-- been replaced by nr functions.
--
-- Modality records contain a field of type Modality-variant. For the
-- variant of the type theory in Sections 3-5 the mode 𝟘ᵐ should be
-- disallowed, i.e. the Modality-variant field 𝟘ᵐ-allowed should be
-- false. Furthermore there should be a dedicated nr function, i.e.
-- the Modality-variant field nr-available should be true (and to
-- match the paper the nr function should correspond to a natrec-star
-- operator).
--
-- Unlike in the paper equality is not required to be decidable.
-- Instead this property is assumed where it is used.

-- 4: Type Theory with Grades

-- The grammar of the language.
--
-- The syntax is not defined in the same way as in the paper:
--
-- * The syntax is well-scoped: the type of terms is indexed by the
--   number of variables in the context.
--
-- * Terms are either variables or applications of "kinds" to terms.
--
-- * The type Kind is indexed by a list of natural numbers. The length
--   of the list specifies the number of term arguments of the "kind",
--   and each natural number specifies how many extra variables each
--   term argument takes.
--
-- For instance, instead of three plain constructors for Π, Σ_& and
-- Σ_⊗ there is a kind constructor Binderkind of type
--
--   (b : BinderMode) (p q : M) → Kind (0 ∷ 1 ∷ []).
--
-- The type BinderMode represents "Π, Σ_& or Σ_⊗", and the two
-- arguments of type M are the two quantities of the binders. (The
-- syntax always allows the graded Σ-types from Section 8.) The list
-- 0 ∷ 1 ∷ [] means that the binders take two arguments, one with n
-- variables in the context (for some n), and one with 1 + n variables
-- in the context.
--
-- Pattern synonyms are used so that one can write code which is
-- closer to the notation from the paper.
--
-- The formalization includes a unit type with η-equality which is
-- discussed mainly in Section 7.3. As discussed above use of this
-- unit type can be disallowed.

-- Weakenings.
--
-- Unlike in the paper the type of weakenings is well-scoped: it is
