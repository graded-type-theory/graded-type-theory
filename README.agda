-- The code does not follow the paper exactly. Notably, the
-- formalisation contains parameters that make it possible to control
-- whether certain features should be included or not (in addition to
-- the possibility to choose what modality to use):

-- * One can have a theory with a single mode, or two modes:

modes = Graded.Mode.Restrictions.Mode-restrictions

-- * One can choose whether to allow use of the unit type with
--   Œ∑-equality. Furthermore one can choose whether to allow binders
--   of the form B_p^q, where p and q are grades and B is "Œ†", "Œ£
--   without Œ∑-equality" or "Œ£ with Œ∑-equality":

types = Definition.Typed.Restrictions.Type-restrictions

--   This parameter does not affect the syntax, but if a term has a
--   certain type ("Unit" or "B_p^q¬†A¬†B"), then this type must be
--   allowed:

Unit-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.‚ä¢‚à∑Unit‚ÜíUnit-restriction
Œ†Œ£-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.‚ä¢‚à∑Œ†Œ£‚ÜíŒ†Œ£-restriction

-- * One can choose whether to allow the term prodrec_r,p^q:

prodrec = Graded.Usage.Restrictions.Usage-restrictions

--   This only affects the usage relation. If prodrec_r,p^q¬†A¬†t¬†u is
--   well-resourced (under any mode), then the term is allowed:

prodrec-allowed = Graded.Usage.Inversion.inv-usage-prodrec

--   One can use this parameter to rule out erased matches:

no-erased-matches = Graded.Restrictions.no-erased-matches

-- Note that some results have only been proved for certain variants
-- of the theory.

-- There are also other differences between the paper and the
-- formalisation. Such differences are noted below.

-- TODO: Note such differences below.

-- 3: Modalities as grades in an ordered semiring

-- Definition¬†3.1: The modality semiring.
--
-- For the variant of the type theory in Section¬†3 the mode ùüò·µê should
-- be disallowed, i.e. ùüò·µê-allowed should be false.
--
-- Unlike in the paper equality is not required to be decidable.
-- Instead this property is assumed where it is used.
