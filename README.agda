-- The code does not follow the paper exactly. Notably, the
-- formalisation contains parameters that make it possible to control
-- whether certain features should be included or not (in addition to
-- the possibility to choose what modality to use):

-- * One can have a theory with a single mode, or two modes:

modes = Graded.Mode.Restrictions.Mode-restrictions

-- * One can choose whether to allow use of the unit type with
--   Œ∑-equality. Furthermore one can choose whether to allow binders
--   of the form B_p^q, where p and q are grades and B is "Œ†", "Œ£
--   without Œ∑-equality" or "Œ£ with Œ∑-equality":

types = Definition.Typed.Restrictions.Type-restrictions

--   This parameter does not affect the syntax, but if a term has a
--   certain type ("Unit" or "B_p^q¬†C¬†D"), then this type must be
--   allowed:

Unit-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.‚ä¢‚à∑Unit‚ÜíUnit-allowed
Œ†Œ£-allowed =
  Definition.Typed.Consequences.Inversion.‚ä¢‚à∑Œ†Œ£‚ÜíŒ†Œ£-allowed

-- * One can choose whether to allow the term prodrec_r,p^q:

prodrec = Graded.Usage.Restrictions.Usage-restrictions

--   This only affects the usage relation. If prodrec_r,p^q¬†A¬†t¬†u is
--   well-resourced (under any mode), then the term is allowed:

prodrec-allowed = Graded.Usage.Inversion.inv-usage-prodrec

--   One can use this parameter to rule out erased matches:

no-erased-matches = Graded.Restrictions.no-erased-matches

-- Note that some results have only been proved for certain variants
-- of the theory.

-- There are also other differences between the paper and the
-- formalisation. Quite a few such differences are noted below.

-- Some modules used below are parameterized by a collection of equality
-- relations over terms and types and properties of these relations.
-- This is used by the reducibility logical relation, allowing the
-- fundamental lemma to be proven for any equality relation satisfying
-- these properties, in particular the normal type and term equality
-- and the algorithmic equality relations.

-- 3: Modalities as grades in an ordered semiring

-- Definition¬†3.1: The modality semiring.
--
-- For the variant of the type theory in Section¬†3 the mode ùüò·µê should
-- be disallowed, i.e. ùüò·µê-allowed should be false.
--
-- Unlike in the paper equality is not required to be decidable.
-- Instead this property is assumed where it is used.
--
-- This module also defines the concept of a modality with "well
-- behaved zero" which is used in Section 6.

Modality = Graded.Modality.Modality

-- Addition, multplication and natrec-star are monotone operations

+-monotone = Graded.Modality.Properties.Addition.+-monotone
¬∑-monotone = Graded.Modality.Properties.Multiplication.¬∑-monotone
‚äõ-monotone = Graded.Modality.Properties.Star.‚äõ-monotone

-- Usage contexts.
--
-- The usage contexts are defined as (length-indexed) lists, not as
-- functions from variables.

Con‚Çò = Graded.Context.Con‚Çò

-- Lifted operators and a lifted ordering relation for usage contexts.

_+_   = Graded.Context._+·∂ú_
_¬∑_   = Graded.Context._¬∑·∂ú_

-- The trivial (one element) modality.

unitModality = Graded.Modality.Instances.Unit.UnitModality

-- With the given definitions of _‚àß_, _+_ and _¬∑_ there is only one
-- lawful way to define the star operator (up to pointwise equality)
-- for the erasure modality.

-- meet).

‚äõ-greatest‚ÇÅ = Graded.Modality.Instances.Zero-one-many.‚äõ-greatest

-- A "linear or affine types" modality.
-- Note that the names of two of the grades differ from the paper.
-- The formalization uses œâ for unrestricted usage and ‚â§ùüô for affine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4: Type theory with grades

-- The grammar of the language.
--
-- The syntax is not defined in the same way as in the paper:
--
-- * The syntax is well-scoped: the type of terms is indexed by the
--   number of variables in the context.
--
-- * Terms are either variables or applications of "kinds" to terms.
--
-- * The type Kind is indexed by a list of natural numbers. The length
--   of the lists specifiy the arities of constructors (the number of
--   sub-terms) and each element how many extra variables each term
--   argument takes. Where applicable, the "kind" also specifies any
--   constructor arguments that are not terms.
--
-- For instance, instead of three plain constructors for Œ†, Œ£_& and
-- Œ£_‚äó there is a kind constructor Binderkind of type
--
--   (b : BinderMode) (p q : M) ‚Üí Kind (0 ‚à∑ 1 ‚à∑ []).
--
-- The type BinderMode represents "Œ†, Œ£_& or Œ£_‚äó", and the two
-- arguments of type M are the two quantities of the binders. (The
-- syntax always allows the graded Œ£-types from Section¬†8.) The list
-- 0¬†‚à∑¬†1¬†‚à∑¬†[] means that the binders take two arguments, one with n
-- variables in the context (for some n), and one with 1¬†+¬†n variables
-- in the context.
--
-- Pattern synonyms are used so that one can write code which is
-- closer to the notation in the paper.
--
-- The formalization includes a unit type with eta equality which is
-- not covered by the paper except for a discussion in Section 7.3.
-- One can disable the use of the unit type at the type level (see
-- above).

grammar = Definition.Untyped.Term

-- Weakenings.
--
-- Unlike in the paper the type of weakenings is well-scoped: it is
-- indexed by two natural numbers, the sizes of the target and source
-- contexts, respectively.
--
-- The lifting constructor ‚áë is called lift, and the shifting
-- constructor ‚Üë is called step.

Wk = Definition.Untyped.Wk

-- Application of a weakening to a de¬†Bruijn index.

weakening-of-variable = Definition.Untyped.wkVar

-- Application of a weakening to a term.

weakening = Definition.Untyped.wk

-- Substitutions.
--
-- Unlike in the paper the type of substitutions is well-scoped: it is
-- indexed by two natural numbers, the sizes of the target and source
-- contexts, respectively.

Subst = Definition.Untyped.Subst

-- Application of a substitution to a term.

_[_] = Definition.Untyped._[_]

tail      = Definition.Untyped.tail

-- The typing relations.
--
-- These relations are parametrised by a value of type
-- Type-restrictions, which can be used to restrict certain types, as
-- discussed above.
--
-- Note also that some rules for Œ† and Œ£ have been merged.
--
-- In some rules fording (equality hypotheses) is used to equate
-- grades. In the paper such equated grades are simply shown as a
-- single grade.

-- 8: Extension: modes and graded Œ£-types

-- Note that for the definitions and theorems in this section,

-- Modes.

-- The mode 1_M is denoted by¬†ùüô·µê. One can choose whether to allow or
-- disallow 0_M. If 0_M is allowed, then it is represented by
-- applications of the constructor¬†ùüò·µê: this constructor takes an
-- argument which indicates that 0_M is allowed.
