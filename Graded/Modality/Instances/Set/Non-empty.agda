-- Non-empty sets of natural numbers

-- These sets do not form modalities, but they satisfy quite a few
-- related properties (given certain assumptions). The only property
-- that is missing (except for those related to ω) is distributivity
-- of multiplication over addition. This property holds if equality is
-- replaced by inequality in a certain way, but if the definition of a
-- modality is changed so that only the weaker variant of
-- distributivity from this module is required, then it seems hard to
-- prove the substitution lemma in Graded.Substitution.Properties.
