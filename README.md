# A Logical Relation for Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory in Agda #

This is a project to formalize a proof of the decidability of conversion of a dependently typed language in Agda.
The source code for the [paper](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~abela/popl18.pdf) can be browsed in HTML [here](https://mr-ohman.github.io/logrel-mltt/decofconv/). Since then, the project has been extended with an empty type, unit type, dependent sums and a concept of modalities including a case study on en erasure modality.
The source code with these extensions included can be browsed in HTML [here](https://fhlkfy.github.io/modalities_and_erasure/Logrel-MLTT.html).

### Dependencies ###

This project is written in Agda and uses its standard library. It has been tested to be working with Agda version 2.6.2.
